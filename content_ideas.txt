- What is an 'intermediate player'?
  - General game knowledge vs knowledge specific to a single piece of content
    - running content solo forces learning more in depth knowledge
      - how to handle dregs vs marauders vs servitors vs champions
      - Threat analysis
      - playing ranges
      - ad spawn locations
      - enemy movement patterns
        - matters for both positioning, and timing attacks (missing rockets on overloads)
      - enemy attacks (ogres push you, psions launch you up high, etc)
      - ammo econ
      - environment factors (explosive barrels, heavy crates, etc)

- Evaluating guns
  - Stats and their meaning
  - weapon archetypes and what they mean
  - how to read light.gg

- How to evaluate armor
  - Stats and their meaning
  - Stat splits explained
  - base totals, spikes, and dump stats

- Builds
  - The harder the content, the more specialized your build may need to get
  - Primary, Special, Heavy: get value out of ammo economy
  - Get a 'feel' for each class and subclass

- Build crafting
  - Gameplay loop: what content am I running, and how to I want to run it?
    - general content style: ad dense vs moving fast vs defend a location etc
      - Any specific mechanics that might need to be addressed (quickly melting knights in Kingsfall: Totem low-man)
      - range considerations
      - content modifiers, surges, threats, shields, loadout-swaps, etc
    - fireteam considerations
      - Solo, or with a team?
        - What's everyone else running, and how comfortable is everyone with this level of content
      - Rock, paper, scissors: survivability, CC, damage
    - Champions
    - Damage phase
  - Subclass
    - Consider what each is good at, tie back to "how do I want to run it"
  - Aspects
  - Fragments
  - Super, class ability, jump, melee, grenade
    - Consider personal playstyle
    - Consider cooldowns, and how integral an ability is to how you want to run
  - Exotics and guns
  - Armor, stat tiers, and mods
  - artifact mods
  - optional: cosmetics :)
  - Testing and tweaking
